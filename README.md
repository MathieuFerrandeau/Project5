Project 5: use public data from OpenFoodFacts


This project uses openfoodfacts data to allow a user to choose from a product list a substitute with a nutriscore superior or equivalent to the chosen product.
As well as to save this substitute so as to retrieve the information that interest the user like the name, stores where to buy it and an url link with all the features of the product.
